# Kickstarter Project
## Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

The objective of this project is to modify and analyze the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects as we attempt to uncover some market trends.

These three Questions were answered based on the analysis:

1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?

Based on the charts created as part of the exercise, the following three conclusions can be drawn about Kickstarter campaign:
Chart-1 shows that the rate of success in the music category is highest followed by Theatre and Film & Videos.
If we filter Chart-2 based on categories, we find that Music has some sub-categories which have 100% success rates with lower number of historical campaigns. (Metal for example), which implies lesser competition for a new project in the sub-category.
Chart-3 can be used to identify the most successful launch month for the campaign- May in this case.

2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?

Unavailability of granular data at each donation level can be one of the limitations in the current data set.
The granular level data can be used to identify trends in the distribution of individual donation values impacting the overall project success, which in turn can be used to decide the nature of the marketing strategy for the fundraising campaign

3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

A success rate line chart can be plotted on a timeline by category/sub-category to evaluate the trend in recent times for identifying projects with a rising success rate.
After category, sub-category and launch month is decided for the fundraising campaign, an additional analysis based on historical rate of fund raising for successful projects can be taken up; by plotting funds raised against the duration of the campaign to establish expected date to launch the project
